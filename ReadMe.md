A Chat Bot Application for [Odysee.com](https://www.Odysee.com)  
If you enjoy and like using the App, be sure to click the Star at top right of your page.

## Installation
If installing from source code then follow this [documentation](https://github.com/GlobalGamer2015/Odysee-Chatter-Bot/docs/Source-Code.md).

Download the latest release from the [releases](https://github.com/GlobalGamer2015/Odysee-Chatter-Bot) page.  
Currently there is only Windows release as I do not have Linux or Mac OS.

## Usage
Download the App, and install it in your AppData folder.  
Once that is done, sign up and MFA bind the account to your Phone using Auth0 Guardian App.
* [Guardian IOS](https://apps.apple.com/br/app/auth0-guardian/id1093447833?l=en)
* [Guardian Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.auth0.guardian&hl=en_US&gl=US)

After you successfully sign up and MFA, you will be taken to a page where you will need to fill out a form with your Claim ID that needs to be from your Odysee About page.  
Finally, you will be asked to restart the Application and then if everything is successful, you will get a notification that you have successfully connected to your Odysee Chat.
